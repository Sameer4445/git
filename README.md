# Live Clock Demo

A minimalistic live clock demo built with GitHub Pages. It dynamically displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

##  Live Demo

Check it out here: [https://sameer4445.github.io/Digital_clock/](https://sameer4445.github.io/Digital_clock/)

When opened, the page renders something like:

The time is now
00 Hours

00 Minutes

00 Seconds

yaml
Copy
Edit

*(It updates in real-time to reflect your current local time.)* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

##  How It Works

- The clock is implemented in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- JavaScript periodically fetches the current time (`new Date()`), parses hours, minutes, and seconds, then updates the elements on the page.
- Likely uses `setInterval()` to refresh every second.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sameer4445/git.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
   cd git
  ```
3. Open index.html in your browser—or use a local server:


live-server

## Usage
The clock starts running immediately upon loading the page.

No interaction needed—time updates every second automatically.

Possible Enhancements
Consider adding:

AM/PM toggle or 24-hour format switch

Handy date display (day, month, year)

Custom themes or time zones

Mobile-responsive styling

Ability to pause or reset the clock

## Summary
This project is a clean, straightforward example of a real-time clock using GitHub Pages. Its minimal code and function make it ideal for learning how JavaScript can interact with the DOM to deliver live updates. Let me know if you'd like an extended demo incorporating themes, toggles, or additional features—I’d be happy to help build it out!
